<p>
If you don't know the current tracks and such, you can click the precheck button.
This will give you a list of all the mkv files in the input directory along with their track info for sub tracks (This may change to include audio later)

Once you have figured out the combination of things you need to do to set the tracks the way you want, click remux.
Currently this created a batch file in the output directory that you need to run manually.

Depending on how the tracks are named or not named, you may have to process the files a couple times.</p>
