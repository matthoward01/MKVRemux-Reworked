If you want to find a track based on the track number, type the number in the Search track field, and set the dropdown to the language you want to change it to.<br>

If you don't know the current tracks and such, you can click the precheck button.<br>
This will give you a list of all the mkv files in the input directory along with their track info for sub tracks (This may change to include audio later)<br>
